## Why Termish?

Termish tells two stories that plain SSH clients can't.

**The pocket front door to your agents.** herdr is the always-on room where your
AI agents live on the server; Termish is the front door you carry in your
pocket. Tap a host and you're in a real window into codex, claude, herdr, vim,
htop — from anywhere, no web dashboard, no extra daemon on your phone.

**Mosh-first: sessions that survive the network.** SSH guarantees
compatibility, Mosh keeps the session alive through WiFi switches and roaming.
Local echo prediction keeps typing snappy at high RTT; a lock screen or an app
switch never costs you your session.

Under the hood, that means a different path from webview terminals: a
**pure-Kotlin terminal emulator** and a **Compose Multiplatform UI** shared
across platforms, with the SSH transport swapped per platform against
battle-tested libraries (sshj on JVM, libssh2 on iOS). All the effort goes
where it matters — the terminal experience.

- **Local-first & private** — Termish connects straight to your servers: no
  account, no cloud sync, no telemetry, no third-party hop. Secrets live only
  in the platform vault (Keystore / Keychain); your agent sessions belong to
  you
- **Open source & free forever** — MIT licensed, auditable, no subscriptions,
  no feature walls
- **Composition-safe IME** — pinyin, kana and hangul never leak to the wire;
  candidate bars fully work (see below)
- **Touch-first TUI input** — fixed CTRL/ALT/ESC toolbar, tap/drag mapped to
  terminal mouse events, so agent TUIs (herdr/codex/claude/vim/htop) stay
  usable on a phone
- **Native everywhere** — no webview, no Electron, one shared Kotlin codebase;
  long-lived agent sessions stay cool and light on battery
- **Terminal-first design** — the emulator, not the transport, is the core asset
- **Built for real workflows** — tmux-friendly sessions, background keep-alive,
  leave-and-return session restore, zero Material-default looks

### CJK input, done right

Webview-based terminals (xterm.js inside Termius & friends) struggle with CJK IMEs on
mobile: composing text gets swallowed or leaked byte-by-byte, and candidate bars often
never appear. Termish's input pipeline is designed around composition from day one:

- IME **composing text never reaches the wire** — only committed text is diffed
  (common-prefix) and sent; pinyin can't pollute the remote line
- `KeyboardType.Text` keeps Chinese candidate bars fully functional
- Backspace semantics are split: composing → IME deletes pinyin; committed → `0x7f`
  key events reach the remote even with an empty local buffer
- Wide chars are 2-cell across buffer, renderer and selection — tails inherit the
  head's colors, so CJK on colored status bars (e.g. agent TUIs) renders cleanly

## Features

**Terminal emulator**
- VT100/xterm escape sequences, UTF-8, wide chars (CJK), alt screen, scrollback
- True color / 256 / ANSI-16, bold, underline, inverse; bundled **JetBrains Mono**
  (identical metrics on every device — no OEM font surprises)
- OSC 8 hyperlinks, OSC 52 clipboard, OSC 10/11/12 color queries, bracketed
  paste (2004), DEC special graphics, DECSCUSR cursor styles
- DECRQSS/DECRQM/DA/DA2 responses, focus events (1004), alternate scroll (1007),
  mouse reporting in X10 / SGR (1006) / urxvt (1015) formats
- Canvas rendering with inertial scrolling, double-tap word select, long-press copy

**Sessions**
- **Multi-session per host** (Termius style): every open starts a fresh session —
  all sessions of a host (plus SFTP) sit side by side in a terminal **tab bar**;
  switch, add, or close tabs, each with its own buffer and status dot
- Session manager with a **Connections tab** — leave a terminal without
  disconnecting, come back to the exact buffer; host cards show a live
  session-count badge
- **Session restore**: on restart, the session list comes back (disconnected,
  tap to reconnect)
- **Foreground service + wakelock** (Android) keeps sessions alive in background
- iOS: backgrounding suspends the app, so the socket drops — returning to the
  app auto-reconnects active sessions and restores the buffer (pair with
  `tmux`/herdr for a server-side session that survives any client drop)
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff; startup command per host
  (`tmux new -A -s main` for true server-side session persistence)
- Real-time connection status in the terminal header

**Mosh**
- SSH bootstrap: `mosh-server` is started over SSH, its UDP port/key parsed, then
  a **pure-Kotlin mosh client** (`dev.termish.mosh`: AES-128-OCB, SSP state sync,
  zlib fragmentation) speaks UDP directly — no GPL native binary needed.
- Per-host **fixed UDP port** for NAS / router port-forwarding setups
- **Theme sync**: your phone's terminal palette (OSC 4/10/11 answers) is injected
  into the Mosh stream, so TUIs like herdr render with your theme instead of the
  host's terminal theme
- Startup command & auto-reconnect work for Mosh sessions too; UDP roaming
  survives Wi-Fi ↔ cellular switches
- **Local echo prediction**: keystrokes render instantly on a predicted overlay
  and are reconciled by echo acks — typing stays snappy at high RTT

**SFTP**
- File browser with upload / streaming download / recursive folder download,
  breadcrumb navigation with back-as-history
- System save dialogs on all platforms (SAF on Android, document picker on
  iOS, file chooser on desktop)

**Input**
- Fixed two-row key toolbar: `CTRL ALT ESC TAB ⌃C ↑ ⌃L ⌨` / `⌃D PST / ⌃E ← ↓ → ENT`
- Sticky CTRL/ALT modifiers combine with the system keyboard (⌃A/⌃E/⌃R …);
  composition-safe IME handling; backspace works even with an empty input buffer
- When a TUI enables mouse reporting, touch gestures map to terminal mouse
  events (tap = click, drag = motion / wheel) — herdr/vim/htop panes stay
  usable on a touchscreen

**App**
- Hosts / Connections / Settings tabs; host search, tags, quick commands,
  password / private-key / encrypted-private-key (PKCS#8, legacy PEM, OpenSSH —
  passphrase asked once per connection, never persisted) & keyboard-interactive
  auth, TOFU host-key verification
- **Bilingual UI** — Chinese / English / follow system, switchable in Settings
- Secrets in platform stores: **Android Keystore (AES-GCM) / iOS Keychain**
- Design system: zinc neutrals + emerald accent, JetBrains Mono titles,
  dark & light themes; terminal palettes (Default / Solarized / Dracula / Light)
- Font size by sp or **target columns** (e.g. 120 cols — desktop-like density)
- Fine-grained tuning in Settings: haptic feedback, cursor blink, OSC 52
  clipboard toggle, keepalive interval, auto-reconnect, TOFU prompt on first use

## Install

- **Android**: download the signed APK/AAB from the Releases page (or the debug
  APK from CI artifacts).
- **Desktop**: DMG / DEB / MSI installers from the Releases page.
- **iOS**: not published in CI — build locally:
  `make ios-native && make ios-framework`, then open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj`
  in Xcode and run on a simulator or device.

## Quick Start

1. **Add a host** — Hosts tab → `+`: name, hostname, port, username, and an auth
   method (password / private key / key-or-password). Tags and quick commands
   are optional.
2. **Connect** — tap the host card. On first connect you confirm the server's
   host key fingerprint (TOFU); after that it is verified automatically.
   Tap the same host again to open another session — tabs switch in the
   terminal page.
3. **Type** — tap the canvas to raise the keyboard. Use the key toolbar for
   CTRL/ALT/ESC and arrows; PST pastes (bracketed-paste aware).
4. **Mosh** — set the host's Connection Mode to Mosh (the server needs
   `mosh-server` installed). Behind NAT, set a fixed UDP port on the host and
   forward it. Enable "Sync terminal theme" for TUIs like herdr.
5. **Keep sessions alive** — set a startup command like `tmux new -A -s main`
   for server-side persistence. Leaving the terminal page keeps the session
   running in the background (Android foreground service); the Connections tab
   re-enters it with the exact buffer.
6. **SFTP** — `+` → Connect via SFTP: browse, upload, download files and whole
   folders.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Unit tests (crypto RFC vectors + terminal emulator + mosh)
./gradlew :composeApp:desktopTest

# Transport integration tests (auto-starts the local test sshd; tests self-detect
# sshd on 127.0.0.1:2222 and SKIP gracefully when absent)
./gradlew testIntegration

# Android APK
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug

# iOS native deps (one-time): OpenSSL + libssh2 → iosApp/native/{include,lib/device,lib/sim}
./scripts/build-ios-native.sh

# Kotlin framework + host app
./gradlew :composeApp:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64
./gradlew :composeApp:linkDebugFrameworkIosArm64
open iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj

# Local test sshd (port 2222, generates ed25519 keys)
./scripts/test-sshd.sh
```

Convenience aliases (`make help` for the full list): `make run`, `make test`,
`make test-integration`, `make lint`, `make release`.

Unit tests cover crypto RFC vectors, the terminal emulator, and Mosh;
transport integration tests self-detect a local sshd and SKIP (not fail)
when it's absent.

Stack: Kotlin 2.1.21 · Compose Multiplatform 1.8.1 · AGP 8.9.2 · Gradle 8.14.2 ·
kotlinx-coroutines 1.10.2 · sshj 0.40.0 · libssh2 1.11.1 + OpenSSL 3.0.16

## Security Model

- Passwords & private keys never touch disk in plaintext — Android Keystore
  (AES-GCM) / iOS Keychain / dev-only file store
- Host keys: TOFU (trust on first use) with fingerprint confirmation; strict
  verification for known hosts
- No telemetry, no analytics, no network calls except your SSH connections

## Known Limitations

- **Android 15 foreground-service timeout**: the 6-hour `dataSync` limit ends
  background keepalive; returning to the app auto-reconnects
- **iOS backgrounding**: the app is suspended and sockets drop; active sessions
  auto-reconnect on return — pair with `tmux`/Mosh for server-side continuity
- **Desktop secrets** live in a plaintext properties file under `~/.termish`
  (dev/test harness only — mobile builds use Keystore/Keychain)
- **iOS is not built in CI**: the iOS native deps (OpenSSL/libssh2) are built by
  [build-ios-native.sh](scripts/build-ios-native.sh) and are git-ignored, so CI
  only covers Android + desktop; iOS changes must be verified locally

## Roadmap

- [x] SFTP file browser & transfers
- [ ] More IME languages — kana (Japanese) / hangul (Korean) composition
  (the pipeline is already composition-safe, see [CJK input](#cjk-input-done-right))
- [ ] Port forwarding (-L / -R)
- [ ] `~/.ssh/config` import
- [ ] Multi-window (split-view) sessions on tablets — multi-tab sessions are
  already supported, see [Features](#features)
- [ ] Secret/key management UI — review and remove keys in the platform vault
  (Keystore / Keychain)
- [ ] Snippets — reusable command fragments, insert-and-send from the toolbar
- [ ] Known-hosts management — pin, review and remove host fingerprints

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
full guide. A few pointers:

- `term/` is pure Kotlin with no platform deps — add a unit test for any escape
  sequence or buffer behavior you touch (`commonTest/`)
- Keep platform code behind the `ssh/SshSession` and `util/` expect/actual seams
- Design tokens live in `ui/theme/` — no ad-hoc dp/alpha values in new UI code
- README.md and README.zh-CN.md are kept in sync; behavior changes to `term/`
  or `mosh/` update the matching docs file
